 - Step 3: Run `docker-compose build` (or `make build`).
 - Step 4: Run `docker-compose up -d` (or `make up`) to start the container.

## NOTE:
 - When first start using the website, it will ask you to input database's information. Use information the same as in the `.env` file. The database host must be `db`, **NOT** `localhost`.
 - Remember to disable or remove any webserver engine (like nginx, apache) that's running on port 80, or the nginx container won't work.
